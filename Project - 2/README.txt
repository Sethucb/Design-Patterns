Provide justification for Data Structures used in this assignment in
term of Big O complexity (time and/or space)

I have used BST to implement Observer pattern.

Adding a node : Adds a node to the tree.
Time - O(n) = worst case
Search for existing node : Check if the tree already has the node.
Time - O(n) = worst case
Removing a course from a node : Removes the course if exist from the courseName arraylist 
Time - O(n) Space - O(n) , n = list of courseName size
Result which write to file : Inorder Traversal to print sorted BST.
Time - O(n) = worst case
Result to store BST : ArrayList to store the Bnumber and course together as a string.
Time - O(n) Space - O(n) , n = number of nodes
Check if course if valid or not : An arraylist with valid courses as String
Time - O(n) Space - O(n), n = list of available courses size
NotifyAll Listeners : An arrayList to add listener which is constant in this case.
Time - O(2) Space - O(2)

Observer pattern:
When adding nodes/courses,I have created node(first time) and added courses to the three 
nodes in the three trees respectively.When removing courses,I call notifyAll(listenerNodes).
notifyAll is called by node_orig and backup_nodes are available as a list in listenerNodes.
I update the courses in listenerNodes by getting the courses from node_orig("this" to refer to it) and making a new list out of it.I set the courseNames in listeners to point to this new reference of coursenames so that they get updated with changes in the courses of node_orig.
