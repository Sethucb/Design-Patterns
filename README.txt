it, nor have I given my solution to anyone else. I understand that if
I am involved in plagiarism or cheating I will have to sign an

Provide justification for Data Structures used in this assignment in
term of Big O complexity (time and/or space)

I have used an ArrayList to store the test results in Result class.
It saves 10 test results and I have iterated over them in main to write
to file and stdout.

I have also included a "testInput.txt" file that is required in one of
the test methods to check for array resizing.
